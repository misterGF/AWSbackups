# AWSbackups
Simple python script to backup your linux box. It includes examples of backing up mongoDB, packages installed, website flat files and server config.

It is very simple to use and feel commented.

Make sure you have python and [boto 3](https://github.com/boto/boto) installed.

After that you can go through the script and plug in your AWS creds, your preferred location to save the backups, etc.
Feel free to fork and make it your own.
